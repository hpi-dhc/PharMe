# App Screens

<!-- Including the export date for PDF export, otherwise would refer to the -->
<!-- commit history. -->

The table below lists descriptions of screens and actions that lead to them.
Actions are usually tapping (👆) or scrolling down (⏬).
If no screen number is given, the action refers to the screen in the previous
table row.

_Please note: as screenshot generation is currently not possible, the screens_
_you see here are the study version screens. Most screens are the same, but_
_in the study version some additional content is implemented._
