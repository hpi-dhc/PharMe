These rare reactions, called idiosyncratic reactions, are individual reactions with not (yet) understood mechanisms that usually do not occur in most patients.\n\nYou can also have multiple types of adverse reactions at the same time, for example a genetic difference that affects how your body processes a drug AND an allergic reaction.\n\nConsult your pharmacist or doctor for more information.",
